[Do Software Engineers Have a Good Work-Life Balance?](https://www.tealhq.com/work-life-balance/software-engineer#:~:text=Work%2DLife%20Balance%20FAQs%20for%20Software%20Engineer&text=On%20average%2C%20Software%20Engineers%20generally,engineers%20might%20work%20longer%20hours.)

I found this article interesting because talking about the reality of work life balance for software engineers is very important and rarely talked about especially while studying computer science. How demanding and what you should do with deadlines and how to keep learning is talked about in this article and also ideas for how engineers can set limits and not get burnout. I liked that it showed the human side of being an engineer and showcases what you would encounter not just the technical work.

We talked about this in lecture a little and because we are learning a lot about teamwork. These skills can help us reduce stress, which makes it easier for us to deliver projects we're proud of.
